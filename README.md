# TECHIN510 Buffet Table Setting Design Project

## Project Scope
Buffet chefs in China’s new first-tier or second-tier cities often struggle to meet the manager’s standards for table settings. This difficulty arises from a lack of template references, leading to significant time, material, and financial investment to achieve the desired aesthetic at a later stage.  

Moreover, many chefs aspire to improve buffet presentation aesthetics or learn about them but lack opportunities to study abroad. They often face challenges in finding relevant information and integrating it effectively. Additionally, in high-traffic scenarios, poor table settings can result in inefficient service and increased food waste.  

To address these challenges, I aim to develop a platform that assists chefs and buffet managers in improving or learning buffet presentation aesthetics. The platform will be designed to support users without a design background, allowing them to efficiently create visually appealing buffet setups while minimizing food waste.  

## Target Users
1. Buffet chefs and managers in China’s new first-tier or second-tier cities.
2. Chefs who lack design training but aim to improve buffet presentation.
3. Managers who require consistent and aesthetically pleasing setups to maintain service quality and minimize waste.
