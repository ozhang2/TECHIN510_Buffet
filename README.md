# TECHIN510 Buffet Table Setting Design Project

## Project Scope
Buffet chefs in China's new first-tier or second-tier cities often struggle to meet the manager's standards for table settings. This difficulty arises from a lack of template references, leading to significant time, material, and financial investment to achieve the desired aesthetic at a later stage.  

Moreover, many chefs aspire to improve buffet presentation aesthetics or learn about them but lack opportunities to study abroad. They often face challenges in finding relevant information and integrating it effectively. Additionally, in high-traffic scenarios, poor table settings can result in inefficient service and increased food waste.  

To address these challenges, I aim to develop a platform that assists chefs and buffet managers in improving or learning buffet presentation aesthetics. The platform will be designed to support users without a design background, allowing them to efficiently create visually appealing buffet setups while minimizing food waste.  

## Target Users
1. Buffet chefs and managers in China's new first-tier or second-tier cities.
2. Chefs who lack design training but aim to improve buffet presentation.
3. Managers who require consistent and aesthetically pleasing setups to maintain service quality and minimize waste.

## Features
A web platform that contains an AI generation tool that generates customized buffet setups based on user inputs. For example, allowing user to select color palette, cuisine type (Western, Chinese), and event theme (seasonal/holiday) and download/save generated images.

## Timeline
Week 2: Basic interface + initial model integration  
Week 3–4: Improve prompt system, enhance image generation  
Week 5: User testing and refinement  
Week 6: Final demo preparation  

## Meeting Notes & Progress Updates
### Client Meeting (April 18, 2025)
**Attendees**: Xinyu Wang (Client), Oulu Zhang (Developer)

#### Key Discussion Points:
1. **Auto Layout Consistency**
   - Ensure Auto Layout is applied to all components for better scalability and alignment
   - Adjust margins, paddings, and spacing to match Figma design specifications
   - Review layout changes in both desktop and mobile breakpoints

2. **Image Integration**
   - Begin integrating visual assets across the website
   - Focus on hero sections and feature highlights
   - Optimize images for fast loading while maintaining quality
   - Discuss image sourcing options (client-provided, stock, or AI-generated)

3. **AI Generation – Subscription Plan**
   - Explore subscription-based model for AI-generated content
   - Potential gated features:
     - Higher-quality output
     - Export options
     - History tracking
   - Need further discussion on:
     - Pricing tiers
     - Value proposition
     - User limitations

4. **Next Steps**
