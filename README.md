# TECHIN510 Buffet Table Setting Design Project

## Overview
Buffet chefs in China's new first-tier or second-tier cities often struggle to meet the manager's standards for table settings. The absence of standardized references leads to time-consuming and costly trial-and-error iterations. Chefs may also lack formal design training or access to international design exposure.

This project aims to create a web platform that helps buffet chefs and managers quickly generate aesthetically pleasing buffet table layouts using AI, minimizing both food waste and effort.

## Target Users
- Buffet chefs seeking design guidance to improve table aesthetics.
- Buffet managers who need consistent and efficient buffet setups.
- Chefs without design training who want structured support to improve visual presentation.
